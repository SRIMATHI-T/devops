DEVOPS PRACTICAL REPORT

Linux and Window:
Windows Operating System:

Windows is a commercial operating system developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for personal computers and enterprise environments.

Features of Windows:

•	Graphical User Interface (GUI) based
•	Easy to use
•	Licensed software (paid)
•	Mostly used for desktop applications
•	Uses PowerShell and Command Prompt for command-line operations

Linux Operating System

Linux is an open-source operating system. It is widely used in servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps environments.

Features of Linux:

•	Open-source (free to use)
•	Highly secure
•	Lightweight and stable
•	Mostly command-line based
•	Used in servers and cloud systems
•	Multiple distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat, etc.)

Difference Between Linux and Windows:


Feature	Windows	Linux
License	Paid	Free & Open-source
Usage	Desktop-focused	Server-focused
Security	Moderate	High
Customization	Limited	Highly customizable
Command Line	PowerShell / CMD	Terminal (Bash)
DevOps Usage	Limited	Highly preferred
 
Virtual Machine (VM)
What is a Virtual Machine?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs inside another computer. It allows us to run multiple operating systems on a single physical system.

For example:
We can run Ubuntu (Linux) inside a Windows system using VMware.

Why Virtual Machine is Used in DevOps?

•	To test applications in different environments
•	To simulate server environments
•	To isolate systems
•	To practice Linux without removing Windows

Important VM Concepts

1.	Hypervisor

A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines. Example:

•	VMware
•	VirtualBox
•	Hyper-V

2.	Guest OS

The operating system installed inside the virtual machine. Example: Ubuntu inside VMware.

3.	Host OS

The main operating system installed on the physical computer. Example: Windows 10.

4.	Networking Modes in VM

1.	NAT (Network Address Translation)
o	VM shares internet connection from host
o	Safe and commonly used
2.	Bridged Network
o	VM acts like a separate computer in same network
o	Gets its own IP address
 
What is WSL?
Definition

•	WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) allows users to run Linux directly inside Windows without installing a virtual machine.
•	It enables Linux commands and tools to run on Windows.

Features of WSL

•	No need for full VM
•	Lightweight
•	Direct integration with Windows
•	Faster than traditional VM

Difference Between WSL and Virtual Machine


Feature	WSL	Virtual Machine
Full OS	Partial Linux Kernel	Full Operating System
Performance	Faster	Slightly slower
Resource Usage	Low	High
Isolation	Less	More
Setup	Simple	Requires installation
VMware Installation and Setup:
